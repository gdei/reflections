When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When sharing work with others or working on the same project from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    When several people are working simultaneosly on a project, another one might do updates to the remote while I have uncommitted local changes. Those would be lost if all changes to the remote would be pulled automatically, so I would rather do that manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. I would use it for developing different flavours of a project, like stable, testing and unstable.
    A clone is an exact copy of a repository that's meant to stay in sync with the original. I would use it for cloning a remote to my workstation or to multiple computers when I have write acces to the remote.
    A fork is like a clone, but without write access to the original repository. I would use it for cloning other people's projects when I want to fork off my own line of development.
