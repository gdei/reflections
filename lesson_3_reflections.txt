When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When sharing work with others or working on the same project from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    When several people are working simultaneosly on a project, another one might do updates to the remote while I have uncommitted local changes. Those would be lost if all changes to the remote would be pulled automatically, so I would rather do that manually.
