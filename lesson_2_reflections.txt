What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    git creates a directory named ".git". Here commits and changes will be stored.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    It doesn't neccessarily contain all files from the working directory. Different from the repository, it contains no informations about commits already been done. The value is, it makes it easy to collect the files for a commit even if it would be difficult to name all files to be added in a commit command
